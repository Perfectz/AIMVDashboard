# Step 1 Writing Guide

Use these constraints when drafting Step 1 content.

## Concept (`concept.txt`)

- Keep to 2-5 sentences.
- Describe protagonist/subject, action, and visual world.
- Include one narrative arc or contrast (e.g., loss -> renewal).

## Inspiration (`inspiration.txt`)

- Include at least two concrete references (films, directors, artists, visual movements).
- Add one sentence that translates references into production direction.

## Mood (`mood.txt`)

- Name primary and secondary emotions.
- Include intensity/energy (low-burn, rising, explosive, restrained).

## Genre (`genre.txt`)

- Combine musical-video genre and visual style.
- Mention camera/lighting texture in one phrase (e.g., handheld grit, glossy anamorphic bloom).

## Style rules

- Prefer specific nouns over broad adjectives.
- Avoid contradictory descriptors unless intentional and explained.
- Avoid placeholder tokens like "TBD" in final saved text.
