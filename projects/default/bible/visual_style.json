  "negativePromptBase": "no text, logos, watermarks, distorted anatomy, cartoon style, flat lighting, plastic skin, modern objects, cheerful colors, literal backstory elements, on-screen text, camera shake",
  "notes": "The two worlds should share a sense of HEIGHT and FLOATING STRUCTURES but with completely different temperatures and physics. Water world: cool, slow, resistant but supportive. Volcanic world: hot, fast, hostile and demanding. All symbolism through environment, posture, and motion—never through text, icons, or literal narrative. Overall tone: melancholic, serious, contemplative. Emotionally heavy but never melodramatic."
