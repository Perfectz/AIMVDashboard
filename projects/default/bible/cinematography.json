The camera must be a distinct presence in each world: a quiet companion in the water world, a dynamic pursuer in the volcanic world. Mirrored compositions create the emotional bridge between worlds. Light crossing their faces in parallel moments, interpreted differently by each world's physics. Editing rhythm: cross-cutting increases in Acts II-III to emphasize the mismatch of speed (her patience vs his force), then slows in Act IV to prepare for the final parallel reach. Aspect ratio should feel cinematic widescreen (2.39:1 equivalent)."
